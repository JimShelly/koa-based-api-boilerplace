Koa-based Api Boilerplate
=========================

The purposes of this project are:
- Learning step by step on how to use Koa, Knex, Typescript, and Objection.
- Create a "step-ladder" approach to developing so others can better understand the complete process.
- Have a real-world, production-ready backend api

## Introduction
There are a ton of projects out there on using Koa, Koa and Knex, Koa and Typescript, Knex and Objection, but not that many that go into details on Koa, Typescript, Knex, and Objection.  There are even less examples when you add in MVC.  

So this is my attempt to create a project that encompasses all these technologies.  I hope to do so in a easy to follow progression. 

## Version 1
Version 1 is my barebones boilerplate.  It shows how to implement koa and koa-router to create an API.  Granted, the API doesn't do much, but it does run.  

The code-base has the following:
- An application structure that is easy to follow and flexible to expand.  
- 100% Typescript 
- Basic routing capabilities
